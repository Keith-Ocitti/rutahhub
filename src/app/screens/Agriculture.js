            <h4>Training on Aqua ponics</h4>
            <p>
              This service involves teaching individuals or groups about
              aquaponics, a sustainable farming method that combines aquaculture
              (raising fish) with hydroponics (growing plants in water). The
              training covers the setup, management, and maintenance of
              aquaponic systems. Participants learn how to create a closed-loop
              ecosystem where fish waste provides nutrients for plants, and
              plants help purify the water for the fish.

              Barley seed refers to the seeds of the barley plant, a cereal
              grain widely used for various purposes like animal feed, brewing,
              and food. These seeds are sown to grow barley plants. Weed seeds,
              on the other hand, are seeds of undesirable plants that can
              potentially grow among cultivated crops and cause harm. Weed seeds
              need to be identified and removed to maintain the health and
              productivity of the desired crop.

              grains, usually barley or other cereal grains, for use as animal
              feed. These trays support the growth of nutrient-rich fodder by
              supplying the seeds with water and nutrients in a hydroponic
              system, enabling rapid and efficient fodder production for
              livestock.
